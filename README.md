## Blog Posts

Create blog posts as MDX files in the `data/` directory. Each post should include frontmatter with title, date, tags, and summary.

date: "2024-01-01"
tags: ["web-development", "nextjs"]
draft: false
summary: "A brief description of your post"
---

Your content here...
```

Content is powered by [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) for type-safe content management.
