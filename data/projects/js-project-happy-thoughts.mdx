## Project Overview

The Happy Thoughts app lets visitors submit short, positive notes that are persisted to an external API. Users can browse latest posts, send hearts, and observe real-time updates through optimistic UI patterns that keep the feed responsive.

## Tech Stack

- React functional components with hooks for state and effect management
- Styled Components for themeable styling and reusable UI primitives
- Fetch API with optimistic updates and retry logic

## Key Work

- Implemented controlled form inputs with validation to cap message length
- Batched API mutations to maintain smooth performance on lower-end devices
- Added pagination and filtering utilities to keep the feed navigable

## Next Steps

- Replace Fetch with React Query for richer caching and background refetching
- Introduce user accounts with authentication to personalise the experience
- Build automated tests around posting and liking flows with Vitest and Testing Library
