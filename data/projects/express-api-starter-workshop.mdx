## Project Overview

This starter repo lays down the scaffolding for a RESTful Express API including health checks, resource controllers, and shared error handling. It served as the foundation for rapid prototyping during backend workshops.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js runtime with Express 4
- Layered routing structure using controllers and services
- Supertest-powered integration harness with Jest
- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code quality

## Key Work

- Wired route modules with middleware for validation, logging, and error translation
- Added environment-driven configuration and process management scripts
- Documented common patterns (pagination, DTOs) inside an onboarding guide for teammates

## Next Steps

- Introduce OpenAPI documentation for interactive client exploration
- Replace the in-memory mock store with a Postgres data layer via Prisma
- Containerize the service with docker-compose for smooth local onboarding
