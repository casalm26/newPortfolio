## Project Overview

This monorepo packages a production-style automation platform for marketing operations. n8n handles the workflow orchestration while a FastAPI microservice generates and schedules AI-authored campaigns that publish to multiple social platforms.

## Tech Stack

- Docker Compose environment with Caddy, n8n, PostgreSQL, Redis, and FastAPI services
- AI content generation via OpenAI with configurable prompts and tone controls
- Prometheus metrics and health checks exposed for each service

## Key Work

- Authored automated deployment scripts that validate server prerequisites and stand up the full stack
- Designed reusable n8n workflows for campaign generation, approval routing, and scheduled publishing
- Implemented FastAPI endpoints covering campaign creation, analytics aggregation, and webhook handling

## Next Steps

- Add SSO and fine-grained access control for larger teams
- Layer in budget pacing and performance anomaly alerts using time-series data
- Build a lightweight React admin to visualise workflows and campaign performance in one place
