## Project Overview

This exercise walks through building a music catalogue that maps Rolling Stone's Top 500 songs into dynamic routes. Users can browse titles on the homepage and drill into detail pages for each song.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with React Router v6 for nested and dynamic routes
- JSON dataset parsed into typed song models
- CSS modules for simple theming and layout controls

## Key Work

- Implemented slug generation to ensure song titles map to predictable URLs
- Added navigation aids like breadcrumbs and back links for better usability
- Provided loader/error boundaries for resilient data fetching across routes

## Next Steps

- Add search and filtering across artist, year, and album metadata
- Introduce audio preview integration using Spotify or Apple Music APIs
- Write unit tests covering route generation and detail view rendering
