## Project Overview

This repo captures slide decks, code snippets, and exercises delivered during the Spring 2025 live sessions. Topics range from modern layout techniques to practical TypeScript refactors and testing workflows.

## Tech Stack

- Example projects built with vanilla JavaScript, TypeScript, and CSS Modules
- Vite-powered sandboxes for quick iteration during sessions
- Supporting scripts for linting, formatting, and test demos

## Key Work

- Authored hands-on labs that progress from fundamentals to real-world integrations
- Recorded instructor notes inside each exercise for asynchronous learners
- Added incremental checkpoints to help students verify their progress

## Next Steps

- Convert the exercises into interactive StackBlitz templates for instant feedback
- Publish accompanying blog posts summarizing each sessionâ€™s key insights
- Add automated CI to ensure starter code remains up to date with dependency upgrades
