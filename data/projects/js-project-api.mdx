## Project Overview

This project explores how to query public APIs, transform responses, and surface the results inside a responsive card layout. Error handling, loading states, and pagination patterns were the core focus areas.

## Tech Stack

- ES modules with Vite for hot-reload development
- Fetch API wrapped in a utility layer for retries and timeouts
- CSS grid system and utility classes for adaptive layouts

## Key Work

- Normalized heterogeneous API responses into a consistent view model before rendering
- Added skeleton loaders and toast messaging to communicate network status to users
- Abstracted request logic into a reusable `apiClient` helper to keep views declarative

## Next Steps

- Introduce filtering and sorting controls to exercise derived state
- Replace the vanilla state handling with a lightweight store such as Zustand
- Add Vitest coverage for the data transformation helpers
