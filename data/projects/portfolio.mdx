## Project Overview

This was my first public portfolio site. The goal was to capture an authentic voice, highlight early projects, and test a content structure that could grow with future work.

## Tech Stack

- Static HTML sections organised around hero, projects, skills, and contact
- CSS custom properties for theme control and light/dark exploration
- Basic scroll animations achieved with CSS only

## Key Work

- Iterated on typography pairings and colour palette until the tone matched the brand
- Crafted concise project blurbs focused on outcomes rather than tasks
- Established a contact CTA that routes to email with prefilled context

## Next Steps

- Convert the static markup into modular components for easier maintenance
- Integrate a blog or update feed to keep the page fresh
- Add analytics to learn how visitors navigate the content
