## Project Overview

When tasked to build a to-do app, I instantly wanted to copy a couple of features from one of my favourite apps: Todoist. Some I succeeeded with, some I didn't (turns out, their semantic style of adding tasks isn't done by a student in a week). As we hadn't started with databases just yet, the whole thing lives in the browser.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript modules and event delegation for interactivity
- LocalStorage-based persistence layer
- CSS custom properties to theme the interface and support dark mode

## Key Work

- Implemented keyboard shortcuts and focus management for quick task entry
- Added filter tabs with ARIA attributes to support screen readers
- Established a small utility library to manage state transitions and logging
- Dark and light mode

## Next Steps

- Sync tasks to a backend API to enable multi-device use
- Introduce subtasks and semantic dates and priorities in the tasks
