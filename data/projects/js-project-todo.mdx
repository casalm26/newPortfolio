## Project Overview

This project revisits the classic to-do list to focus on clean state management and accessible interactions without relying on frameworks. Tasks are stored locally and can be filtered by completion status.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript modules and event delegation for interactivity
- LocalStorage-based persistence layer
- CSS custom properties to theme the interface and support dark mode

## Key Work

- Implemented keyboard shortcuts and focus management for quick task entry
- Added filter tabs with ARIA attributes to support screen readers
- Established a small utility library to manage state transitions and logging

## Next Steps

- Sync tasks to a backend API to enable multi-device use
- Introduce subtasks and due dates with calendar integration
- Add unit tests around reducer logic to guard against regressions
