## Project Overview

This repository tracks the initial concept for a Buzzfeed-style quiz experience created during intro days. While the implementation is still forthcoming, the project outlines question flows, result logic, and UI references.

## Tech Stack

- Planned stack includes vanilla JavaScript for quiz logic and CSS for theming
- Wireframes drafted in Figma to explore the card-based layout
- Collaboration notes captured in Notion to coordinate next steps

## Key Work

- Defined personas, question banks, and branching outcomes for a playful onboarding quiz
- Sketched mobile-first layouts to ensure the experience works great on phones
- Identified data structures for storing answers and calculating results

## Next Steps

- Implement the quiz engine with progressive enhancement and result sharing
- Add analytics to track completion rates and question drop-off
- Build content management hooks so new quizzes can be added without code changes
