## Project Overview

VQM is a Swedish stock advisory service that delivers research-backed tips tailored for retail investors. Working within a handed-off Figma design, I implemented the custom WordPress theme and content architecture that clarifies the value prop and drives prospects toward subscription.

The project ran as a six-week internship through Technigo. I collaborated closely with another developer and adhered to a provided Figma design system, focusing on faithful implementation, performance, and subscription infrastructure.

## Key Features

- **Conversion-focused hero** highlighting VQMâ€™s three investment plays (quality stocks, bid arbitrage, spinoffs) with clear CTAs and social proof embedded throughout the scroll.
- **Subscription journey** that layers in FAQs, risk disclosures, and context so visitors understand the offer before committing.
- **Content hub** for articles and historic tips powered by Gutenberg blocks, giving editors the flexibility to publish without developer help.
- **Accessibility-minded design** with strong contrast ratios, generous touch targets, and smooth responsiveness from mobile up to widescreen.

## Technical Highlights

- Authored a lean WordPress theme (`wp-content/themes/vqm.se`) with modular PHP partials and reusable Gutenberg blocks to keep content structured.
- Leveraged Bootstrap 5 as the layout engine and layered a custom SCSS design system to express the VQM brand, including typography delivered via Adobe Typekit.
- Wired up Yoast SEO, Open Graph metadata, and schema markup to secure strong search visibility and correct previews across social platforms.
- Integrated Stripe for payments and KIT for subscription management, connecting both services to WordPress so the client can manage plans, billing, and communications in one place.
- Configured Google Tag Manager with compliant cookie handling so the business can track subscription conversions without new deploys.

## Results

- Launch delivered a fast, mobile-first site scoring under two seconds on Lighthouse 4G simulations.
- The revamped subscription journey now produces a steady stream of leads thanks to sharpened messaging and frictionless CTAs.
- Editorial teams publish tips and long-form articles independently, greatly reducing developer bottlenecks.

## Next Steps

- Extend the block library with performance snapshots and case studies that visualise historic returns.
- Layer in a membership system for gated premium insights and automated subscriber updates.
- Refine SEO focus areas using live data from Search Console and Tag Manager.
