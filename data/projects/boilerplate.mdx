## Project Overview

This repository packages a full-featured marketing site foundation built on Next.js 15 and the App Router. It ships with shadcn UI primitives, dark and light theming, SEO tuned metadata, and a Contentlayer powered MDX blog so new projects can launch with a complete content strategy from day one.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with React Server Components
- TypeScript first component model and utilities
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui for rapid UI composition
- Contentlayer backed MDX publishing workflow
- Vitest, Playwright, and k6 for unit, integration, E2E, and performance coverage

## Key Work

- Curated a reusable layout system, content models, and design tokens for fast rebranding
- Automated quality gates with linting, formatting, type checking, and multi-layered tests
- Added Dockerized test harness with PostgreSQL, Redis, and MongoDB to mirror production services

## Next Steps

- Package additional industry-specific landing page variants
- Expand analytics integrations beyond Vercel and Google Analytics
- Refine deployment scripts for one-click provisioning across hosting providers
