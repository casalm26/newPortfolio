## Project Overview

This exercise implements a simple dog fact viewer that calls a public API on mount and distributes the response to presentation components. The project demonstrates clean separation of concerns across container and display layers while practising state updates triggered by asynchronous effects.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with functional components
- Vite dev server for fast feedback
- Native Fetch API for network requests
- CSS modules for lightweight styling

## Key Work

- Configured `useEffect` to manage API calls with proper loading and error states
- Normalized incoming API data before exposing it to the `DogFact` child component
- Added prop-type shape documentation and defensive guards to prevent runtime issues

## Next Steps

- Introduce pagination or filtering to showcase stateful list updates
- Persist the latest fetched fact in localStorage for offline viewing
- Wrap network calls in a reusable data hook shared across future exercises
