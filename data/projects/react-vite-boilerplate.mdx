## Project Overview

This template trims React projects down to the essentials so students can focus on component architecture. It includes routing, state examples, testing setup, and a consistent file structure for quick project kickoffs.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with Vite build tooling and hot module replacement
- ESLint + Prettier preconfigured alongside basic testing via Vitest and Testing Library
- Sample components, hooks, and service modules illustrating common patterns

## Key Work

- Documented file organization, naming conventions, and component patterns for bootcamp usage
- Added starter tests, lint rules, and formatting scripts to enforce quality from day one
- Provisioned example API service and mock data to accelerate initial feature work

## Next Steps

- Provide light/dark theming examples and advanced routing scenarios
- Include a Storybook configuration for rapid UI prototyping
- Publish the template as a GitHub template repo for easier reuse
