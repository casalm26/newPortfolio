## Project Overview

This dashboard provides current conditions and multi-day forecasts sourced from a public weather API. TypeScript types guard the fetch pipeline and ensure UI components only render when data is valid.

## Tech Stack

- TypeScript with strict mode enabled for type-safe fetch handling
- Vite build tooling with environment variable support
- Tailwind CSS for rapid UI composition and responsive design

## Key Work

- Modeled API responses with TypeScript interfaces and guards to avoid runtime errors
- Added geolocation support and manual city search with debounced requests
- Created reusable cards for current conditions, hourly breakdown, and multi-day outlooks

## Next Steps

- Introduce charts for temperature trends using Recharts or Chart.js
- Cache results with IndexedDB for offline access
- Add unit tests around utility functions that calculate sunrise/sunset and heat index
