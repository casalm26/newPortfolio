## Project Overview

Built as part of the Technigo curriculum, this site demonstrates how to craft accessible UI primitives without relying on heavy frameworks. The emphasis sits on semantics, aria attributes, and clear focus management for users navigating via keyboard or assistive tech.

## Tech Stack

- HTML templates with landmark roles and descriptive headings
- CSS utility classes to maintain contrast ratios and focus outlines
- Vanilla JavaScript to orchestrate skip links, modals, and form validation

## Key Work

- Audited the experience with Lighthouse, VoiceOver, and axe DevTools, then resolved critical issues
- Implemented reduced-motion friendly animations that respect user preferences
- Documented accessibility acceptance criteria within the README to guide future contributions

## Next Steps

- Extend coverage with automated axe tests during CI
- Translate content and aria labels to Swedish for broader reach
- Package reusable accessible components into a shared repository for future projects
