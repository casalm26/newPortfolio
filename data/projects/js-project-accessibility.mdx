## Project Overview

Built as part of the curriculum at my bootcamp with Technigo, the task here was to craft accessible UI primitives without relying on heavy frameworks. The emphasis sits on semantics, aria attributes, and clear focus management for users navigating via keyboard or assistive tech. And I tried having some fun with it!

## Tech Stack

- HTML templates with landmark roles and descriptive headings
- CSS utility classes to maintain contrast ratios and focus outlines
- Vanilla JavaScript to orchestrate skip links, modals, and form validation

## Key Work

- Audited the experience with Lighthouse and some plugins, then resolved critical issues
- Implemented reduced-motion friendly animations that respect user preferences
- Documented accessibility acceptance criteria within the README to guide future contributions
