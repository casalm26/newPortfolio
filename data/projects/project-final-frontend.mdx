## Project Overview

This capstone pairs a modern React SPA with an Express API backed by MongoDB. Users explore datasets through interactive maps, charts, and filters while the backend provides secure authentication, rate limiting, and CSV export utilities.

## Tech Stack

- React 18 with Vite, React Router, Zustand state management, and Styled Components
- Visualization stack including Leaflet, MarkerCluster, Recharts, and XLSX parsing
- Express API with MongoDB, JWT authentication, validation middleware, and Jest + Supertest coverage

## Key Work

- Designed a dashboard layout combining filter panels, map views, and analytic charts
- Implemented data ingestion and seeding pipeline for consistent test environments
- Hardened the API with authentication, validation, and rate limiting to protect resources

## Next Steps

- Deploy the stack with Docker Compose and proper CI/CD pipelines
- Add role-based access control and audit logging for enterprise readiness
- Expand testing suite with end-to-end scenarios using Playwright
