## Project Overview

The unit-tests repository houses a set of intentionally failing specs designed to test debugging skills. The goal is to read test expectations, repair implementation code, and ensure the suite passes without weakening coverage.

## Tech Stack

- Jest test runner with Babel for module support
- Sample utility functions covering math, strings, arrays, and async flows
- ESLint and Prettier for consistent code formatting

## Key Work

- Audited each failing test, identified root causes, and fixed the underlying implementation bugs
- Added guard clauses and input validation to harden utility functions
- Documented learnings and edge cases uncovered during the debugging process

## Next Steps

- Expand coverage with property-based tests for numerical helpers
- Integrate the suite into CI to catch regressions automatically
- Port key utilities to TypeScript for better type safety and editor support
