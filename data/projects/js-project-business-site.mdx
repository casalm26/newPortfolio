## Project Overview

This project assembles a marketing site for a friends' business, applying storytelling through hero, features, testimonials, and pricing sections. The primary goal was refining layout rhythm and CTA hierarchy across breakpoints. This was one of the first projects we did during my 9-week bootcamp at Technigo.

## Tech Stack

- Hand-authored HTML templates and include files
- Modular CSS partials for typography, spacing, and color palettes
- Simple build pipeline via npm scripts for minification and asset copying

## Key Work

- Crafted a cohesive brand voice and imagery plan to reinforce the value proposition
- Implemented mobile-first breakpoints and fluid typography for better readability
- Integrated reusable CTA and testimonial components to speed up future page creation

## Next Steps

- Add a blog/news section to keep the site fresh and improve SEO
- Wire contact forms to a serverless endpoint with spam filtering
- Run usability testing sessions to validate the information hierarchy
