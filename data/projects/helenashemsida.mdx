## Project Overview

This project delivers a bespoke marketing presence for Helena with localized copy, service descriptions, and a light-weight gallery system. Each page is hand-coded to keep loading times minimal while preserving a polished visual identity.

## Tech Stack

- Semantic HTML templates for index, about, process, and legal pages
- Modular CSS architecture to reuse typography and color tokens
- Vanilla JavaScript for navigation state, hero animations, and contact form validation

## Key Work

- Organized layout variants (home, about, process) into a consistent grid and spacing system
- Implemented language-specific metadata and Open Graph tags to boost search discovery
- Optimized images and lazy loading to maintain fast performance scores across devices

## Next Steps

- Migrate recurring components into a small templating system for easier updates
- Add Netlify Forms or a dedicated serverless handler for contact submissions
- Introduce analytics and cookie consent to comply with regional regulations
