## Project Overview

This portfolio prototype was created to practice structuring content as modular sections, balancing storytelling with clear calls to action. Animations and scroll-triggered reveals were used sparingly to add personality while maintaining accessibility.

## Tech Stack

- HTML sections grouped into reusable components (hero, work, testimonials)
- Sass-inspired CSS architecture compiled via npm scripts
- Lightweight JavaScript to drive smooth scrolling, reveal animations, and form validation

## Key Work

- Crafted custom SVG iconography and background patterns to support the visual brand
- Tuned typography scale and spacing tokens to keep the content legible on smaller screens
- Added structured data snippets to boost discoverability on search engines

## Next Steps

- Convert the static build into Contentlayer-backed MDX pages for easier updates
- Integrate analytics and conversion tracking for newsletter signups
- Explore bundling the design system into Storybook for future reuse
