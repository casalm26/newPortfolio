## Project Overview

SchoolOS is an end-to-end system designed to help trade schools track coursework, grades, and student progress. The monorepo hosts a Vite-powered client, an Express API, worker utilities, and shared packages for types and UI.

## Tech Stack

- React + TypeScript frontend with component-driven architecture and Zustand state
- Express backend with MongoDB persistence, seeding scripts, and validation layers
- Shared tooling for linting, formatting, testing, and npm script orchestration via concurrently

## Key Work

- Established a monorepo structure with shared ESLint config, scripts, and CI scaffolding
- Implemented grading workflows across client and server, including seeding and fixtures
- Created developer documentation in `AGENTS.md` to onboard contributors quickly

## Next Steps

- Deploy the platform with Docker Compose and managed MongoDB services
- Add role-based permissions and audit logs for administrative oversight
- Build automated regression tests covering grade submissions and reporting exports
