## Project Overview

This repository powers my current portfolio. It extends the base boilerplate with custom layouts, MDX-powered storytelling, and a project taxonomy tailored to my mix of client work, experiments, and coursework.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js App Router with server components, dynamic metadata, and streaming routes
- Contentlayer for typed MDX content, including projects, blog posts, and timelines
- Tailwind CSS plus shadcn/ui for component primitives
- Comprehensive automated tests (Vitest, Playwright, k6) running in CI

## Key Work

- Designed reusable section components that adapt typography and spacing responsively
- Added data-driven project pages sourced from GitHub metadata and Contentlayer collections
- Hardened the build pipeline with type checking, linting, and preview deployments per branch

## Next Steps

- Layer in case study templates with richer storytelling and multimedia support
- Integrate analytics dashboards to surface engagement metrics directly in the site
- Explore using the Contentlayer structured data to generate PDF portfolios automatically
