## Project Overview

This lesson project recreates a multi-section marketing page while focusing on semantic structure and accessible navigation patterns. The exercise reinforced core HTML authoring skills without relying on JavaScript frameworks.

## Tech Stack

- Handcrafted HTML templates
- Utility CSS for layout, typography, and spacing
- Lighthouse and screen reader passes to validate accessibility

## Key Work

- Structured content with headings, landmark roles, and descriptive link text
- Tuned responsive breakpoints to ensure the layout stays readable on mobile and desktop
- Implemented focus-visible states and color contrast improvements for WCAG compliance

## Next Steps

- Add simple JavaScript interactions such as accordions using progressive enhancement
- Expand the stylesheet to include a lightweight design token system
- Document the accessibility testing checklist alongside the project
