## Project Overview

This full-stack e-commerce platform was built to demonstrate modern web development practices with a focus on user experience and scalability. The application features a clean, responsive interface with robust backend functionality.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login with JWT tokens
- **Product Management**: Dynamic product catalog with search and filtering
- **Shopping Cart**: Persistent cart functionality with local storage
- **Payment Processing**: Integrated Stripe payment system
- **Admin Dashboard**: Complete CRUD operations for products and orders
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design approach

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Architecture
- Built with Next.js 14 for optimal performance and SEO
- State management using React Context API
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid development
- Form validation with React Hook Form and Zod

### Backend Development  
- RESTful API built with Node.js and Express
- PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- File upload handling with Multer
- Rate limiting and security middleware

### Database Design
Designed a normalized database schema handling:
