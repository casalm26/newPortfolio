## Project Overview

VideoBooker streamlines video marketing for local businesses. The monorepo hosts a Next.js 15 marketing and dashboard app, an Express API with Zod validation, worker scaffolding, and shared packages for UI, types, and utilities.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js App Router frontend featuring landing pages, dashboards, and placeholder operational surfaces
- Express API exposing endpoints for business setup, integrations, scheduling, and asset management
- Shared packages containing UI components, data models, and utility helpers compiled with TypeScript
- Playwright, Vitest, and linting workflows to keep quality high across workspaces

## Key Work

- Crafted the dashboard shell with navigation, theming, and example routes for each product vertical
- Implemented API endpoints for business onboarding, service management, and integrations
- Set up workspace-wide scripts for linting, type checking, and consistent developer ergonomics

## Next Steps

- Flesh out data persistence layers connecting to a relational database and queue system
- Add real booking workflows, messaging, and analytics visualisations
- Deploy the stack with managed infrastructure and observability dashboards
