## Project Overview

The recipe library provides a responsive catalogue of dishes that users can search and filter by dietary preference. Each card links to a detailed view containing ingredients, steps, and cooking notes.

## Tech Stack

- Vanilla JavaScript SPA patterns with hash-based routing
- JSON data source normalized into typed recipe models
- CSS grid and flex layouts for adaptive card galleries

## Key Work

- Implemented text search, tag filtering, and sort controls with debounced input handling
- Persisted favourite recipes in localStorage for returning visitors
- Added print styles and shareable deep links for individual recipes

## Next Steps

- Replace static data with a headless CMS or custom API
- Add user generated content submission with validation workflows
- Incorporate nutrition data visualizations using D3 or Chart.js
