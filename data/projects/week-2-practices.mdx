## Project Overview

Week 2 practices consolidate multiple exercises from the bootcamp curriculum. Each mini-project focuses on a single concept such as semantic markup, responsive navigation, or applying utility classes.

## Tech Stack

- Static HTML files organised per exercise
- CSS modules experimenting with Flexbox, Grid, and fluid spacing
- Optional JavaScript snippets to reinforce DOM fundamentals

## Key Work

- Iteratively refined layout solutions using mobile-first media queries
- Practised accessible patterns like skip links, ARIA labels, and meaningful alt text
- Documented takeaways for each exercise to track progress over the week

## Next Steps

- Revisit the exercises with TypeScript and React to apply the same layouts in a component model
- Automate formatting and linting to keep the exercises consistent over time
- Capture before/after screenshots to visualise improvements
