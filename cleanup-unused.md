# Unused Files & Folders Inventory

This document lists files and folders in the repository that are not currently referenced by the Next.js application, build tooling, or test suites. Use it as a checklist when cleaning up the repository. Items under **Assets to Keep** are still in active use (for example, deployment docs in `deploy/`).

## Candidates for Removal or Archiving

| Path                                               | Status                | Evidence                                                                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `demo/basic-examples/*`,<br>`demo/form-examples/*` | Not imported          | No imports in `app/`, `components/`, `lib/`, or tests. Only included in `tailwind.config.js` scan globs for demo purposes.     |
| `data/cv-timeline/timeline.json`                   | Duplicate dataset     | Application loads `@/data/cv/timeline.json` instead; this version is legacy (referenced only in `typescriptErrors.txt`).       |
| `experiences.json`                                 | Unused JSON           | Not consumed anywhere in the codebase (`rg "experiences.json"` returns no hits outside the file). Superseded by timeline data. |
| `frontmatter.json`                                 | Editor-only config    | Used only by the VS Code Front Matter extension; optional for runtime/build. No references in scripts.                         |
| `Portfolio project.txt`                            | Obsolete planning doc | Requirements document not referenced in code or tooling.                                                                       |
| `typescriptErrors.txt`                             | Generated log         | Captured TS warnings from an earlier run; not part of current workflow.                                                        |

## Generated Artifacts (Safe to Delete Between Runs)

These directories are ignored by git and can be cleared to reduce noise:

| Path                 | Reason                                                                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `playwright-report/` | HTML report output from `npm run test:e2e`.                                            |
| `test-results/`      | JSON/screenshots generated by Playwright (paths configured in `playwright.config.ts`). |

## Assets to Keep

| Path                                                                  | Reason                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `deploy/` (README, setup scripts, guides)                             | Actively referenced for deployment; keep server setup guides and automation scripts. |
| `database/`                                                           | Used by Docker-based test workflows (`docker-compose.test.yml`).                     |
| `Dockerfile.test`, `docker-compose.test.yml`, `scripts/test-hooks.js` | Required for CI/test infrastructure even if tests are skipped locally.               |

## Additional Candidates Identified During Deep Review

- **`app/animations-test/page.tsx`**  
  _Status:_ Playground route  
  _Evidence:_ Developer-only animation sandbox, not linked from navigation; remove or move behind a draft flag.

- **`components/icons/ThreadsIcon.tsx`**  
  _Status:_ Not imported  
  _Evidence:_ No references in app/components/tests; redundant alongside pixel social icons.

- **`components/icons/TiktokIcon.tsx`**  
  _Status:_ Not imported  
  _Evidence:_ Same as above; unused in social links.

- **`app/calendar/page.tsx`, `app/careers/page.tsx`, `app/faq/page.tsx`, `app/news/page.tsx`, `app/gdpr/page.tsx`, `app/cookies/page.tsx`, `app/share-information/page.tsx`, `data/config/colors.js`**  
  _Status:_ Legacy Tree Partner copy  
  _Evidence:_ Boilerplate marketing copy and theme comment from earlier project—either rewrite for Caspian.dev or drop entirely.

- **`components/blog/LatestArticles.tsx`**  
  _Status:_ Not imported  
  _Evidence:_ Leftover landing/blog composite; no routes import it.

- **`components/icons/PricingCheckIcon.tsx`, `components/icons/XIcon.tsx`**  
  _Status:_ Not imported  
  _Evidence:_ Custom social icons unused in UI.

- **`components/shared/ActiveLink.tsx`, `components/shared/FooterSupportButton.tsx`, `components/shared/PageLoading.tsx`, `components/shared/PixelLoading.tsx`, `components/shared/MobileNav.tsx`, `components/shared/PixelButton.tsx`**  
  _Status:_ Not referenced  
  _Evidence:_ Superseded by other implementations; only tests touch them.

- **`components/shared/ui/*` (alert, accordion, dropdown, etc.)**  
  _Status:_ Template imports  
  _Evidence:_ ShadCN wrappers bundled with boilerplate but absent from current pages—prune the unused subset to reduce bundle size.

- **`components/landing/**`(problem agitator, CTA backgrounds, pricing, testimonials, etc.)**  
*Status:* Mostly unused  
*Evidence:* Only`PixelArtName`, `LandingProductFeature(s)`, and newsletter widgets are active; consider pruning the rest or moving to a separate starter kit.

- **`.DS_Store` files in `components/` and `components/landing/`**  
  _Status:_ Artifact  
  _Evidence:_ Remove tracked Finder metadata.
