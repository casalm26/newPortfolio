# Cleanup Summary

All previously flagged dead assets have been removed, including the demo showcase, legacy CV data, auxiliary planning docs, duplicate icons, and the unused landing/`shared/ui` component catalogue. Policy and deployment assets that power the live site remain untouched.

## Remaining Follow-Ups

| Path / Area                                    | Next Action                                                |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/cookies`, `app/privacy`, `app/terms`      | Rewrite copy to match the current Caspian.dev voice.       |
| `data/config/colors.js`                        | Align comments/palette with the new branding (optional).   |
| Playwright artifacts (`playwright-report/`, etc.) | Clear after each run if disk space becomes a concern. |

No other unused modules are present after this pass.
